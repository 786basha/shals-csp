                        The basic need for human being is clothing. It has equal importance to food and shelter. In olden days the handloom sector was the unique supplier to the clothing needs of the people in the world. The word handloom derives from the process of manual operation of a country wooden structure called the loom. The handloom sector in India is the largest sector next to agriculture. The handloom sector in India today presents many sided and complex problems which are more complicated in view of its Socio-Economic Importance.

                            <b>1. Knowledge of Handloom Weaving:</b> Understand the basic principles of weaving ,including Handloom structure, production processes, collection of yarn, competition with powerlooms. Gain knowledge of handlooms and their marketing problems, infrastructural constraints, high price of yarn.
                        <br><br>
                        <b>2. Yarn selection and Weaving:</b> Acquire knowledge of different types of yarns, their weaving requirements, and  techniques. Learn how to select appropriate yarn based on factors like quality, vibrant colours, market demand, and weaving practices.
                        <br><br>
                        <b>3. Empowering Handloom Weavers:</b>: Skill upgradation, Marketing Techniques, Access to Finance are three key points for empowering handloom weavers. Some of the NGO’s support the skill of the weavers.
                        <br><br>
                        <b>4. Impact of Powerlooms on Handlooms:</b> Weavers Bear the Brunt as Powerlooms Displace the Handloom Sector.Due to its neglect by suc-cessive governments in independent India, the handloom sector is fast losing its battle with the powerloom industry.

                        sericulture, the production of raw silk by means of raising caterpillars (larvae), particularly those of the domesticated silkworm (Bombyx mori).The production of silk generally involves two processes:

1.Care of the silkworm from the egg stage through completion of the cocoon.
2.Production of mulberry trees that provide leaves upon which the worms feed.


                        Here are some stages of production of silk:
                        <br><br>
                        <div class="intxt">
                        <b>1. Sericulture:</b> This is the term used to describe the process of gathering the silkworms and harvesting the cocoon to collect the materials.Female silkmoths lay anything from around 300 – 500 eggs at any one time. These eggs eventually hatch to form silkworms, which are incubated in a controlled environment until they hatch into larvae (caterpillars).
                        <br><br>
                        <b>2. Thread Extraction:</b> Once the silkworms have spun their cocoon, they will eventually enclose themselves inside it and then it’s time to extract the silk threads.The cocoons are placed into boiling water in order to soften and dissolve the gum that is holding the cocoon together. This is a crucial step in the silk production process as it ensures that there is no damage to the continuity of each thread.
                        <br><br>
                        <b>3. Dyeing (IPM):</b> When the silk threads have been washed and degummed, they will be bleached and dried before the dyeing process commences.Traditional silk dyeing techniques take the dyes from natural resources found in the surrounding environment, such as fruit or indigo plant leaves. The threads will be soaked together in bundles, inside a pot of hot indigo leaves and water. This process will occur multiple times over a span of days to ensure proper colour tone and quality.
                        <br><br>
                        <b>4. Spinning:</b>The traditional spinning wheel has always, and will always be an integral part of the silk production process. Although updated industrial processes are now able to spin silk threads much quicker, it simply mimics the functions of the classic spinning wheel.
                        <br><br>
                        <b>5. Weaving:</b> Weaving is the process in which the final piece of silk comes together. There are many different ways in which silk can be woven – satin weave, plain weave and open weave are most common, and the finish of the silk will depend on the type of weave.
                        <br><br>
                        <b>6. printing:</b> Should a piece of silk require a special pattern or design, it will need to be printed after pre-treatment. This can be done in two different ways: Digital Printing or Screen Printing.
                        <br><br>
                        <b>7. Finishing:</b> In order to be deemed ready for use, silks must be finished. Finishing a piece of silk gives it that highly lustrous sheen that it is so commonly known for, and is the reason that the desired look and feel can be achieved.
Silk finishing can be done in many different ways, mainly by applying different chemical treatments which can add a host of valuable properties including fire resistance and crease-proofing.
