    <p>ABSTRACT
       The basic need for human being is clothing. It has equal importance to food and shelter. In olden days the handloom sector was the unique supplier to the clothing needs of the people in the world. The word handloom derives from the process of manual operation of a country wooden structure called the loom. The handloom sector in India is the largest sector next to agriculture. The handloom sector in India today presents many sided and complex problems which are more complicated in view of its Socio-Economic Importance. .</p>
      <p>
        Handloom weavers are facing hardship in carrying out their livelihood on handloom due to competition with power loom sector, marketing problem, infrastructural constraints and rising yarn prices. Similarly the containing features of in the handicrafts sector are scarcity of appropriate raw material, lack of infrastructure facilities. 
      </p>
      <p>Powerloom production has to be decreased and Handloom production has to be increased vice-versa. Government has to provide the funds to the weavers to buy the silk.To reduce the difficulties faced by Handloom weaving we selected Chennur (V),Gudur(M),Nellore(D).
